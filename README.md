## App Brainstorming (Step 4)

1. Spotify
    - Shuffles music
    - Recommending Music
2. Messages
    - Create confetti when sending celebratory text
    - React emojis to text
3. Calendar
    - Add alerts for phone notification to events
    - browse events on daily, weekly, and monthly view

App Idea:
Friends.mp3 would be an app that allows users explore music together across space. Users would be able to create collaborative playlists, sync listening, and chat/react to music with their friends or people in the community without being in the same space. To add customization, chat rooms can stream music based on mood, activity, genre, etc.
